    "# Q1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Encapsulation : Think of encapsulation as putting data and the code that works with that data into a neat package called a class. This helps to keep things organized and makes sure that no one can mess with the data directly, only through the methods provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Abstraction : Abstraction is about hiding the complicated stuff and showing only the essential features. Imagine you’re driving a car: you don’t need to know how the engine works to drive it, you just need to know how to use the steering wheel and pedals. Similarly, in programming, abstraction helps you focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Inheritance : Inheritance lets you create a new class based on an existing class. It’s like inheriting traits from your parents. For example, if you have a class for “Vehicle,” you can create a class for “Car” that inherits features from “Vehicle,” and then add more specific features just for cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Polymorphism : Polymorphism means \"many shapes.\" It allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. For example, you can use a general “Animal” type to refer to a “Dog” or “Cat,” and they can all respond to the same method (like “makeSound”) in their own unique ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Composition : Composition involves building complex objects by combining simpler ones. Instead of creating a big, complex class, you make smaller classes and put them together. For example, a “Computer” class might be made up of “Processor,” “Memory,” and “HardDrive” classes. This way, you can change or update individual parts without affecting the whole system."
